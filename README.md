This module is a simple interface to any generic CLOI-based device.


Xtralien
--------

CLOI is an open-sourced project from the Engineers at [Xtralien](http://xtralien.com)
to help support easy scientific research, but it was designed to be simple, and work in
quite a lot of scenarios.


Design Goals
------------

You can read more about CLOI on the [Xtralien website](http://xtralien.com) but essentially it was designed with the
goal of being easy to extend.
To this end, from a technical standpoint it is easy to add more functionality to CLOI, which is as simple as writing
a function and attaching the function to CLOI.
From an end-user standpoint it is also easy to use, with the main interface being text, as if you were typing commands
into a terminal.
